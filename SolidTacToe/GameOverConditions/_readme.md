# SolidTacToe.GameOverConditions

Contains all the "normal" ways that a game can end.

The IGameWonCondition contains a "Winner" property that instructs it which token to look for. If the condition is met, it therefore contains the winner.

The IGameTied conditions don't care about who's turn it is.
